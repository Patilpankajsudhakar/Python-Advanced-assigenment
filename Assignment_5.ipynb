    "Q1. What is the meaning of multiple inheritance?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "    Inheritance is the mechanism to achieve the re-usability of code as one class(child class) can derive the properties of another class(parent class). It also provides transitivity ie. if class C inherits from P then all the sub-classes of C would also inherit from P."

Let's say we have an object x and want to change the behaviour of just one of its methods. we can create a new class that provides a new implementation of the method we're interested in changing and delegates all other methods to the corresponding method of x."

    "Answer:\n",
    "It is one of the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming. In this concept, we describe a class that references to one or more objects of other classes as an Instance variable. Here, by using the class name or by creating the object we can access the members of one class inside another class. It enables creating complex types by combining objects of different classes. It means that a class Composite can contain an object of another class Component. This type of relationship is known as Has-A Relation."

    "Answer: \n",
    "A bound method is the one which is dependent on the instance of the class as the first argument. It passes the instance as the first argument which is used to access the variables and functions. In Python 3 and newer versions of python, all functions in the class are by default bound methods."
