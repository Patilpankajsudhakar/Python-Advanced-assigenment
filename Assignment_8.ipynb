Exceptions are raised using the statement RAISE EXCEPTION and handled using CATCH in a TRY control structure. Class-based exceptions can be raised in any procedures and can be further propagated by any procedures. A common class based and user defined exception in a single program as shown in preious assignments can be division by zero."

    "Answer: Accordig to recent updates the standard exceptions are Python classes, and a few new standard exceptions have been added. The obsolete AccessError exception has been deleted. Because it is possible (although unlikely) that this change broke existing code, the Python interpreter can be invoked the command line option -X to disable this feature, and use string exceptions like before. This option is a temporary measure - eventually the string-based standard exceptions will be removed from the language altogether. It hasn't been decided whether user-defined string exceptions will be allowed in Python 2.0."
